This project ensures third-party (3P) products meet regional energy labeling standards through a scalable, automated compliance workflow. Product listings are validated for correct documentation and region-specific requirements. Non-compliant items trigger a reinstatement process where sellers are notified and prompted to submit valid documents. The modular Python architecture includes validation scripts, reinstatement logic, and flowchart documentation, supported by automated testing. The system ensures transparency, traceability, and compliance enforcement across the catalog.
